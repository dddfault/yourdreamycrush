            <span class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-condensed">Ramen is widely known imported from China to Japan, ramen-noodle shops first sprang to popularity in both countries in the early 1900s, and the noodles were actually called “Chinese soba” noodes in Japan up until the 1950s. A large number of overseas Chinese to settle in the three major ports – Yokohama, Kobe, and Nagasaki, thus forming Chinatown and provides a cheap and quickly choice for the poor working class. It was Chinese workers selling meals from food carts who likely first introduced the Japanese to the wheat-based noodles.</span>

          <p>
            <span class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-condensed">But ramen’s popularity in Japan skyrocketed after the Second Sino-Japanese war, when Japanese troops returned home from China with a new appreciation for Chinese cuisine.At that time, it is said that the Japanese called it “Dragon Noodle”, which means that the dragon (Chinese) eats noodles.The term ramen was first introduced in the Taisho era. In 1918, it was said that the earliest appearance was Yokohama. The first thing that is popular with ramen is in Tokyo. The earliest ramen house was the Lai Lai in the Asakusa in Tokyo in the Meiji 43 years. This store has started the traditional Japanese-style soup which has bonito and kelp broth mixed with pork bone or chicken bone soup to became a Tokyo-style soy sauce ramen.</span>

          <p>
            <span class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-condensed">Over time, ramen is not cheap and easy food anymore. After continuous research and re-creation by the Japanese, it has becomed popular and well-known gourmet. It has been said that in the 1990’s, ramen houses were popping up all over Japan and quickly became must-go destinations for the commuter and the traveller. While it’s hard to say with 100% accuracy, it’s probably not too far fetched to say that ramen was a dish invented in China, but made trendy in Japan. And there’s certainly no doubt that Japanese restaurants have really made the dish their own since being introduced to it. Ramen is now clearly an international dish with multi-country followers. The ramen was not only carried forward by the Japanese, but its influence expanded to the whole world.</span>
